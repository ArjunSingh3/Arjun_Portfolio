  "about": "I hold a Bachelor of Science in **Electrical & Computer Engineering** from Brigham Young University, where I graduated with a 3.73 GPA. \n\n I have over a year of combined experience at Intel as a SoC Physical Design Engineer, currently working with the Full Chip Timing and Reliability Validation teams. Previously, I interned with the Standard Cell Design and Clock Verification teams, where I focused on physical design, applied machine learning, and debugging SystemVerilog assertions. \n\n My undergraduate journey was shaped by both teaching and hands-on engineering projects. I served as a Teaching Assistant and Assistant Lecturer for a senior-level Machine Learning course, where I helped students engage with complex concepts. As an analog circuit designer, I led course development projects at BYU that impacted three different classes, reducing costs by more than $40,000 and lowering the Junior Project Lab expense from $400 to just $30 per student, making engineering education more accessible for future students. \n\n I also had the privilege of leading the BYU Supermileage team as Team Principal, where our car achieved **1,918 miles per gallon** and won first place in the Shell Eco-Marathon’s Internal Combustion Engine category, competing against teams from across North and South America. \n\n I will begin my Master’s degree at the University of Toronto in January 2026, where I aim to further my expertise in VLSI design and machine learning, with the long-term goal of becoming an open-source professor who makes advanced engineering knowledge more accessible.",
